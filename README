TimerOS:
========

TimerOS is an OS coding example that may help you to begin OS developing. It will not 
do much things. Just, it will print a message in real mode when loading the 
system into the memory. Then, it will use the timer interrupt to print the time
in protected mode. The time will be updated everytime a timer interrupt (IRQ0) is 
generated. In other words, this example will turn your PC into a digital clock :)
